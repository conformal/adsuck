.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm adsuck
is a small DNS server that spoofs blacklisted addresses and forwards all other
queries.
The idea is to be able to prevent connections to undesirable sites such as ad
servers, crawlers and other nasties.
It can be used locally, for the road warrior, or on the network perimeter in
order to protect machines from malicious sites.
.Pp
.Nm
replies to bad addresses with a spoofed DNS packet that has the NXdomain
flag set.
This in effect prevents the application that is resolving the address from
trying to connect to this address.
Addresses that are not matched are forwarded to the normal nameserver,
as provided by
.Xr resolv.conf 5 .
.Pp
Note that when applications try to be smart
and resolve an address with the local domain name appended,
it will still spoof the answer.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar directory
This is the chroot directory.
If it is not specified, it uses the home_dir entry from
.Pa /etc/passwd .
.It Fl D
Do not daemonize.
.It Fl d
Enable debug output.
.It Fl f Ar resolv.conf
This is a standard formatted resolv.conf file that contains the name server that
can resolve non-blacklisted entries.
.It Fl l Ar listen
This is the address
.Nm
will listen on.
The default is all IP addresses.
.It Fl p Ar port
This is the port number that
.Nm
will bind to.
The default is 53.
.It Fl r Ar regexfile
Filename of a file that contains one regex expression per line e.g.\&
banner|ads|stat|track|click.
When the expression is matched,
the DNS response will be spoofed.
The regex engine runs before the hostsfile match.
See
.Xr regex 3
and
.Xr re_format 7
for more information.
.It Fl u Ar user
This is the user that
.Nm
will drop privileges to after it binds to the listen address.
The default is _adsuck.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose output.
.It Ar hostsfile
This is a standard formatted hostsfile that contains all blacklisted entries.
Examples of good blacklist files:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://rlwpx.free.fr/WPFF/hosts.htm
http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/
.Ed
.El
.Pp
Sending
.Nm
a SIGHUP signal will cause it to reevaluate the resolv.conf file.
A SIGUSR1 signal will cause it to reread all hostsfiles and regex file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "resolv.confXXX"
.It Pa hostsfile
Blacklist entries in standard hostsfile format.
The entries must point to 127.0.0.1.
E.g. 127.0.0.1 badsite.com.
.Pp
If the entry points to a different address then the spoofing will not be done
via NXdomain but will instead return the provided IP address.
This enables the administrator to forward specific sites to an IP address that
might contain a warning.
In order to spoof badsite.com to 192.168.0.1 add "192.168.0.1 badsite.com" to a
hostsfile.
.It Pa resolv.conf
Standard resolv.conf file that contain the actual resolving
nameserver and options.
